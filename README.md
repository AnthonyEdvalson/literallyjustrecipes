# Literally Just Recipes

This is the website for "LJR", a fun little prompting experiment to see if I could make an LLM make a coherent story.

For [some reason](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/muffins) I decided to make this in the format of recipe preambles.

This repo has the scripts to generate the stories, as well as the HTML for the actual site. In true LLM project fashion,
The HTML was also written using LLMs.

It uses GPT-3.5 turbo because I am cheap, and it works well enough if you finagle the prompts properly. You can easily swap
it out for something more powerful if you want.

Also, the website is hosted off the gh-pages branch because reasons. Main has the real code.
